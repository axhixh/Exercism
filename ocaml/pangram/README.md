# Pangram

Determine if a sentence is a pangram.

Determine if a sentence is a pangram. A pangram (Greek: παν γράμμα, pan gramma,
"every letter") is a sentence using every letter of the alphabet at least once.
The best known English pangram is "The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog."

The alphabet used is ASCII, and case insensitive, from 'a' to 'z'
inclusively.


## Getting Started
For installation and learning resources, refer to the
[exercism help page](http://exercism.io/languages/ocaml).

## Installation
To work on the exercises, you will need `Opam` and `Core`. Consult [opam](https://opam.ocaml.org) website for instructions on how to install for your OS. Once `opam` is installed open a terminal window and run the following command to install core:

opam install core

## Running Tests
A Makefile is provided with a default target to compile your solution and run the tests. At the command line, type:

```bash
make
```

## Interactive Shell
`utop` is a command line program which allows you to run Ocaml code interactively. The easiest way to install it is via opam:
```bash
opam install utop
```
Consult [utop](https://github.com/diml/utop/blob/master/README.md) for more detail.
